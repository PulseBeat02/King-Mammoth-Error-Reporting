# King-Mammoth-Error-Reporting

# What is This Mod For?

This mod has the goal of hoping to help promote diagnosing bugs, glitches, and problems when running the modpack. Therefore, this java mod will be ideal to help notifying the user of a bug or glitch when they encounter one. Additonally, they will be given the option on whether they will want to email us the crash report to help prevent further isses. (The crash report user data will be hidden)

# Releases

We have not yet released anything, however, please wait. We have just started this project a couple weeks ago, and it will require many steps towards to solve, including byte code manipulation, the making of batch files and possibly dll files, and many other tough "stuff".

# Other Infornmation

Thats all for now. I will be hoping to add more to this text file. Thank you for reading this.
