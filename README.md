# More Important Information While Reading JAVA Files

When viewing these files, go to the src/main section in the Master-Branch. For your convenience, do not go to bin as it will contain .class files that will require decompiling in order to view the code. (src/main will have .java files, which are viewable in github)

# Reporting Issues, Bugs, and Asking Questions

If you would like to report an issue, do so in the "Issues" tab. Do not text me privately asking for changes in the mod. 

If you have anymore questions, please ask me in the Issues tab. 

# Releases

We have not yet released anything, however, please wait. We have just started this project a couple weeks ago, and it will require many steps towards to solve, including byte code manipulation, the making of batch files and possibly dll files, and many other tough "stuff".

# Other Infornmation

Thats all for now. I will be hoping to add more to this text file. Thank you for reading this before accessing any project files.
